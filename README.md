# Questions that need answers. 

1. What coding language is this community? Is it diverse?

2. What can you do here? Can you create games? 

3. How can I become a member of a team or group? So, can any individual request to join a group or is it just certain types of people who are more qualified to join a group than others. Like, how does this work? 

I am both excited and nervous, it's complicated. I am hoping to find a partner.  

Hoping to hear (rather see) from someone soon.
